Climate Action Pledge 
A small, modern single-page React application (Vite) that lets users create and share climate action pledges. Pledges are stored locally in the browser, displayed on a live pledge wall, and can be exported as a printable certificate.

What is this project?
The Climate Action Pledge is an interactive single-page app where users can submit pledges to take climate-friendly actions. Each pledge can include multiple commitments. After submitting, users get a downloadable certificate and their pledge appears on a public pledge wall. The project was created as an internship task and demonstrates frontend skills including React state management, DOM interaction, client-side persistence, and client-side export to image/PDF.




Tech stack & dependencies
Main libraries and tools used (from package.json):

React 19 (react, react-dom) — UI library.
Vite (vite) — Dev server and bundler.
Framer Motion (framer-motion) — Animations and motion effects.
html2canvas (html2canvas) — Capture HTML elements as canvas images for certificate export.
jsPDF (jspdf) — Generate PDF files from captured images.
Dev / tooling dependencies:

@vitejs/plugin-react — Vite plugin for React.
eslint, @eslint/js, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-react-refresh — Linting and code quality.
@types/react, @types/react-dom — TypeScript type definitions (dev-only).
Project structure (important files)
index.html — Vite entry HTML.
src/main.jsx — React mount point.
src/App.jsx — Root component: state, localStorage persistence, main layout and routing anchors.
src/App.css, src/index.css — Global styles.
src/components/ — Reusable UI components:
Hero.jsx — Top hero section.
KPIs.jsx — Displays counts and basic metrics.
WhyAction.jsx — Informational section.
PledgeForm.jsx — Form for creating new pledges.
Certificate.jsx — Renders a printable certificate and handles export.
PledgeWall.jsx — Lists submitted pledges.
AboutModal.jsx — About modal with project info.
public/ — Static assets served by Vite.
How it works (flow)
On app start, App reads a pledges array from localStorage and initializes the React state. If parsing fails or nothing exists yet, an empty array is used.
The UI shows a hero, KPIs (including total pledge count), informational sections, the pledge form, and a pledge wall.
When a user submits the PledgeForm, App.handleFormSubmit:
Builds a new pledge object: assigns an id, adds date, and computes stars from the number of commitments.
Prepends the pledge to the pledges state.
Stores the new pledge in localStorage (via a useEffect that watches the pledges state).
Sets currentPledge and toggles showCertificate to render the Certificate component.
Smooth-scrolls to the certificate area to present the generated certificate.
The PledgeWall reads the same pledges state and shows the live-updating list of pledges.
The Certificate component can export the certificate using html2canvas to capture the DOM element and jsPDF to produce a downloadable PDF or image.
Reveal and visual animations are triggered using an IntersectionObserver and Framer Motion where appropriate.
Key implementation details
Persistence: The app uses the browser's localStorage for persistence. Reads are wrapped in try/catch to handle malformed data, and writes are done on each change to the pledges state.
ID generation: IDs are generated by finding the current max id among pledges and adding 1, with safe fallback to 1 for the first pledge.
Certificate export: html2canvas captures an HTML node and returns a canvas/image. jsPDF is then used to create a PDF from that image for download.
Reveal animations: An IntersectionObserver adds in-view CSS classes when elements come into view to trigger CSS transitions.
UX: After pledge submission the UI scrolls smoothly to show the certificate and provides a visual confirmation of success.
How I built it and what changed / effects
What I implemented:

Built the entire frontend SPA using Vite + React.
Implemented a form-driven flow for creating pledges with multiple commitments.
Implemented client-side persistence, so data persists across reloads and sessions in the same browser.
Added a certificate generation feature to let users download their pledge as a PDF/image.
Added scroll reveal animations and smooth scrolling for better user experience.
Effects and user-facing changes:

Users can create and re-open the app and still see their pledges.
The pledge wall provides social proof and encourages more pledges.
Downloadable certificates allow users to share or keep a record of commitments.
Run locally
Clone or copy the repository to your machine.

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

Open the app in your browser at the URL Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

To build and preview a production bundle:

npm run build npm run preview

Available scripts
npm run dev — Start the Vite dev server.
npm run build — Build a production-ready bundle.
Future improvements / TODOs
Add a backend API so pledges can be shared across devices and users.
Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader testing).
Add unit and integration tests and include CI checks.
Allow users to share/export pledges as shareable links or post directly to social media.
Add pagination, filtering, or search to the pledge wall for large data sets.
